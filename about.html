                    Hi! I'm Raymond, and I graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a B.S. double major in Statistics & Data Science and Psychological and Brain Sciences.

                    As someone who grew up living abroad for a good amount of my childhood, I developed an interest in learning about different cultures. During college, I became fascinated by the idea of pursuing this interest by harnessing real-world data to better understand people, which led me down the path of data science and analysis. 

                    I am especially passionate about utilizing my skills and exploring my interests in the entertainment industry because I believe entertainment has the unique ability to allow people to connect with each other by knocking down cultural barriers and dissolving any differences in people's backgrounds. Think about the movie <i>Parasite</i>: How was it such an international success despite being made by a small country in Asia?

                    In my free time, I like to play sports and video games, watch anime, sing, and also find new music to listen to! 

                    Feel free to look through my projects! 

                </p>
